Hagbad is a decentralised savings platform helping communities build wealth together, free from debt, fear, or financial exclusion.

Hagbad is a fintech platform designed to digitalise traditional saving circles that already exist within communities. 
We aim to offer ethical financial solutions by leveraging blockchain technologies, with transparent interest-free financial services. Our goal is to bridge the gap of financial exclusion by providing 
financial literacy lessons on our platform, credit-building features, and low fees. We want to use a decentralised system in order to accommodate low fees per user, making it accessible for people who want to manage money with their community, 
without needing to rely on interest-based products or loans.

Whilst Hagbad aims to leverage Stellar due to being a low-cost stablecoin infrastructure, we are exploring how Polkadot could support future expansions.
We see potential in using Polkadot’s SDK to build a custom parachain that can host the logic for rotating savings circles, allow for automated trust scoring, and introduce identity and reputation modules linked to user reliability.
Polkadot’s cross-chain capability also opens up the opportunity to connect our savings model with other DeFi platforms in a way that still respects the values of our community. 
This could allow us to expand use cases while keeping the platform decentralised and affordable.

Hagbad was created to help people break free from cycles of poverty, financial fear, and generational money trauma.
We're not here to break away from banks. We're here to build a support system that works alongside them, for people who have always had to rely on each other when the system didn’t show up for them.
As a first-generation university student, I watched my parents struggle financially—not because they didn’t work hard, but because they didn’t have access to trusted financial tools, or even know where to begin.
I saw the fear they had around credit cards, debt, and interest. But I also saw the strength of our community. When they met others from the same country, they started participating in a Hagbad. If someone was late on rent or struggling, the Hagbad payout came through.
It wasn’t about loans or credit—it was about trust. Now I want to modernise that same system for first-generation kids like me. I want them to use Hagbad to save with their friends or family and break free from survival mode. 
I want them to build businesses, buy cars, own homes, and learn about money without shame or fear. I know the mindset our parents had—scarcity, hoarding, doing everything themselves. And I know how that passed down to us. Some of us overspend to feel better, some of us hold onto every penny like we’ll lose it all.
I want Hagbad to help us unlearn that. This isn’t just about saving money. It’s about building each other up so we can finally breathe, build, and live better.


### Project Details

Hagbad is being developed using Flutter for a mobile-first experience across iOS and Android. For backend services, we are integrating Firebase, which will handle user authentication, cloud storage, and database management through Firestore.
 We are also implementing Stellar to handle low-cost, stablecoin-based pooled group savings and payouts. Fiat-to-crypto conversion will be facilitated through Cowrie, a Stellar Anchor, and automated fiat payments will be managed through **Open Banking** providers such as Crezco or TrueLayer.

Documentation of Core Components, Protocols, and Architecture:
- The frontend is built in Flutter and includes the core user journeys, such as joining or creating a group, contributing to a cycle, and viewing payout status.  
- Firebase will handle authentication and data models for users, groups, and transactions.  
- Bank account payments will be automated via Open Banking integration.  
- Funds will be pooled and redistributed using Stellar-based USDC transactions, managed through smart contracts or multisig logic.  
- An admin panel design has already been completed to manage group performance, activity, and troubleshooting.  
- Push notifications are under consideration, pending Firebase Cloud Messaging integration and user journey review.

PoC/MVP or Prior Work: 
We have a complete Flutter codebase with the core UI components and user flow developed. The admin panel UX design is complete, and the user journey has been mapped out in detail. 
We are now in the stage of integrating payments, finalising Firebase backend services, and resolving unfinished code to complete our MVP.


Mockups/Designs of UI Components:  
We have designs for:
- Group savings dashboard  
- Contribution and payout tracking  
- Onboarding and authentication  
- Group creation and management

These mockups focus on simplicity, clarity, and accessibility, especially for users new to fintech apps.


Data Models / API Specifications of Core Functionality:
Key models include:
- Users: auth credentials, group memberships, wallet IDs  
- Groups: member list, monthly amount, cycle order, payment status  
- Transactions: user ID, amount, date, status  
- Payout Queue: group ID, order, recipient, status

APIs will support:
- Creating and managing savings groups  
- Logging and validating contributions  
- Managing payout orders  
- Admin-level moderation and data queries

What the Project Will *Not* Provide or Implement: 
Hagbad is not a lending platform and will not offer loans, interest-bearing accounts, or any products involving riba. It will not offer speculative investment, yield farming, or cryptocurrency trading functionality.  
Users will not be expected to manage private keys or interact directly with wallets or blockchains — all backend activity will be abstracted to offer a Web2-style user experience.  
At this stage, Hagbad will not include credit-building or financial literacy lessons, although these may be explored in future versions. Notifications and real-time messaging features are currently not implemented but may be considered later in development.


Here’s a full response to the **Ecosystem Fit** section for Hagbad, written clearly and in your tone — showing the value you bring without claiming things you're not doing yet.



### Ecosystem Fit

Hagbad introduces an interest-free, community-driven savings platform into the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem. 
While we are currently developing on Stellar for its low fees and native stablecoin support, we see future potential in building a custom parachain using the Polkadot SDK to enable on-chain group savings logic, user reputation scoring, and cross-chain access to other DeFi tools — all in a way that stays aligned with ethical and cultural values. We believe Hagbad brings financial coordination tools to the ecosystem that serve a new, often-overlooked demographic: users seeking collective, ethical, non-loan-based ways to manage and build capital.


Our core audience is our own user base — individuals and communities who already participate in informal savings circles like Ayuuto, Chamas, and Jama3ya. These include first-generation migrants, working-class families, and young entrepreneurs, many of whom are credit-invisible or choose not to interact with traditional lending or interest-based products. If integrated into the Polkadot ecosystem, we would also become relevant to wallet developers, DeFi protocols, and UX builders looking to onboard new types of users or integrate savings and pooling mechanics into their own offerings.

Hagbad addresses the need for ethical, transparent, and accessible financial tools for users excluded from or underserved by traditional banking. It provides an alternative for users who do not want to take on debt or use credit cards but still need a system to build savings, access lump sums, and work toward large financial goals. It also fills a major gap in the Web3 space: financial services that prioritise trust, consistency, and shared responsibility — not speculation or lending.

These needs were identified through:
- Direct experience: As a first-generation university graduate, I saw my family and community rely heavily on informal Hagbads, while avoiding loans and credit cards.
- Community validation: We’ve conducted interviews, surveys, and informal focus groups with individuals who actively use offline savings circles and expressed interest in digitising them.
- Articles such as:  
  - “Banking the Unbanked with Blockchain” – MIT Technology Review*  
  -“Why Informal Financial Systems Work for the Poor” – World Bank Group*  
  - Global Findex 2021* report showing over 1.4 billion adults remain unbanked — many of them relying on informal systems instead.
- Our participation in entrepreneurship programmes also highlighted the lack of trusted, ethical finance tools for new founders and families trying to build wealth without going into debt.

We have explored the Polkadot Forum and wiki but haven’t found any projects specifically replicating or modernising traditional savings circles in a decentralised way. Most Web3 projects in the ecosystem focus on lending, staking, or yield-based DeFi — which serve different user goals and risk profiles. 
Hagbad is distinct because it’s not about earning through investment, but growing wealth through community saving and rotation, similar to traditional Ayuuto models. If any previous attempts have been made, they may not have been successful because the infrastructure didn’t yet support stablecoin-based micro-payments, or the approach did not align with the social dynamics and trust models required to replicate informal saving systems in digital form.

There are similar ideas outside Polkadot, such as:
- Bloom Money in the UK, which digitalises group savings using a centralised model
- Rotating Savings apps in Kenya or Nigeria, usually with limited automation or scale
- DeFi pooling protocols, which differ significantly due to their speculative nature and technical barriers

What makes Hagbad unique is our focus on decentralisation, ethical finance, and user experience that feels culturally familiar, even if the tech behind it is complex.
